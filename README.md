# x86_64 Assembly programming examples

 * Uses System V calling convention
 * AT&T syntax
 
### Tools

 You'll need:

 	* GNU Assembler (as)
 	* GNU Linker (ld)
 	* GNU Compiler Collection (gcc)

 We're using GCC to link C code, with our assembly code.

 Don't open issues etc etc... if you are not using GCC compiler.
